          Out of the total fertile land in the country,
          sugarcane is being cultivated on around 81,000 hectares of land. Though Nepal is in the 33rd
          position among the countries producing sugarcane in the world, sugarcane farming is not
          prospering in this situation also.

      <h2>PADDY</h2>
      <p>Rice is by far the most important crop in Nepal and accounts for about 50 percent of the
        total agricultural area and production in the country.

          It is grown on about 1.45 million ha,
          and total production since 1988/89 has hovered between 3.2 million and 3.5 million tonnes.
          Rice contributes approximately one-fourth of GDP and more than 75 percent of the working
          population is engaged in rice farming for at least six months of the year.

      <h2>MAIZE</h2>
      <p>Maize is the second most important crop after rice in terms of area and production in Nepal.
        It is a way of life for the hill farmers of Nepal.

        <p>
          It is a traditional crop grown for food,
          feed and fodder. In Nepal, the reasons for low maize yield are high temperature, drought,
          stalk rot infestation, high input rates and use of low quality and substandard seeds.
          Nepal's average maize yield is 2.67 tones per hectare, one of the lowest in South Asia.
          Maize demand is increasing at a rate of 11 percent annually in Nepal.
